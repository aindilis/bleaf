Notes ----- Afaik there are likely more recent versions floating
around, this is the latest version I have.  It integrates with some
Perl software called "elle Ethical Consumer", which is responsible for
helping to generate boycott lists.

I am releasing this per the agreement with elle Inc., and will try to
soon release the elle Ethical Consumer, in the hopes that some other
android developers will take it an improve on it so that it will help
people to vote with their dollars.

I really want there to be a crypto aspect where signatures are
verified from trusted sources.  Future versions might benefit from a
(defeasible?)  theorem prover for reasoning about who the user ought
to buy from based on the knowledge available to them.
